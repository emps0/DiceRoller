This project is an abstraction of a real life bag of dice. The user can enter the number of dice to roll and get a randomly generated value displayed on the screen based on the inputs.

This was my first Java project, which helped me understand:
> Basic Java syntax
> Exception handling and JSwing
> Application of OOP Principles in Java
